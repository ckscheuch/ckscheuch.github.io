Entrepreneurs thereby generate demand information and may condition the product development on it. I characterize the profit-maximizing crowdfunding mechanism in a setting where consumers have private information about their valuation of the potential future product. Two types of demand uncertainty matter for the optimal mechanism: the number of consumers who positively value the product and the magnitude of their valuation. A flexible price commitment that depends on the number of pledgers can implement first-best financing outcomes, but there exist parameter constellations under which entrepreneurs prefer fixed prices.

For identification, we exploit sharp discontinuities in the size of the overdraft limit based on an income rounding rule the app uses to assign credit limits. In the cross section, we find similar responses for young and old users, users with high and low income volatility, and users with steep and flat income paths. The most liquid users---those with high ratios of deposits to income inflows---drive the consumption spending response. These results are not fully consistent with models of financial constraints, buffer stock models with and without durables, present-bias preferences, or the canonical life-cycle permanent income model. We discuss a new channel, the perceived precautionary savings channel, which appears consistent with all our results. Under this channel, households with higher liquid wealth behave as if they faced strong precautionary savings motives even though no observables suggests they should do so.","tags":null,"title":"Perceived Precautionary Savings Motives: Evidence from FinTech","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Nikolaus Hautsch](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/nikolaus.hautsch/)","[Christoph Scheuch](https://ckscheuch.github.io/)","[Stefan Voigt](https://voigtstefan.github.io/)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"7a755c2d16372cc64eb49a7f21d349a3","permalink":"https://christophscheuch.github.io/publication/stochastic-latency/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stochastic-latency/","section":"publication","summary":"Distributed ledger technologies rely on consensus protocols confronting traders with random waiting times until the transfer of ownership is accomplished. This time-consuming settlement process exposes arbitrageurs to price risk and imposes limits to arbitrage. We derive theoretical arbitrage boundaries under general assumptions and show that they increase with expected latency, latency uncertainty, spot volatility, and risk aversion. Using high-frequency data from the Bitcoin network, we estimate arbitrage boundaries due to settlement latency of on average 124 basis points, covering 88% of the observed cross-exchange price differences. Settlement through decentralized systems thus induces non-trivial frictions affecting market efficiency and price formation.

Using survey data on firm-level prestige, we show that lenders compete more intensely for prestigious borrowers and offer lower upfront fees to initiate lending relationships with prestigious firms. We also find that banks expand their lending after winning prestigious clients. Prestigious firms benefit from these relations as they face lower costs of borrowing even though prestige has no predictive power for credit risk. Our results are robust to matched sample analyses and a regression discontinuity design.","tags":null,"title":"Fishing with Pearls: The Value of Lending Relationships with Prestigious Firms","type":"publication"}]
